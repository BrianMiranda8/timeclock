# PHP Time Clock Manager

Here's a web application I've crafted with PHP, focused on streamlining the time management process for businesses.

Key Features:

- Clocking Mechanism: Allows employees to accurately clock in and out.

- Employee Management: Managers can create new employee profiles and modify existing information.

- Punch Oversight: Employees can view and verify their recorded time punches.

- Managerial Control: Managers have the ability to adjust, add, or remove employee punches as needed.
